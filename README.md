# BulletControl

## Project Description

This repository contains the Unity project `BulletControl`, which represents a specialized system for managing bullet behavior. This system was developed as a key component of the game Ricochet Master, published on the Yandex Games platform. The project focuses on implementing unique physical models and interaction mechanics for bullets within the game environment.

## Features

The `BulletControl` system, developed for Ricochet Master, includes the following key features:

-   Unique Ricochet Physical Model: Implementation of custom physics that accounts for bullet interaction with various surface materials.
-   Calculation of Reflection Angles and Energy Loss: The model accurately simulates bullet bounces, considering the angle of incidence and surface characteristics, as well as the loss of kinetic energy with each reflection.
-   Intuitive Trajectory Control: The system supports the mechanic of intuitive real-time bullet flight control, which is the foundation of Ricochet Master's unique gameplay.

## Connection to Ricochet Master

`BulletControl` is an integral part of the game Ricochet Master. The code contained in this repository implements the "Innovative bullet control system" and the "unique ricochet physical model," which are fundamental mechanics of the game. This repository demonstrates the technical side of implementing projectile behavior in the game.

> The game Ricochet Master is a project published on Yandex Games, where players use strategic thinking and precision to control bullet trajectories, relying on ricochets to complete levels. The BulletControl system is at the core of this mechanic.

## Technologies

The project is developed using the following primary technologies:

-   Game Engine: Unity
-   Programming Language: C#

## How to Use/Run

The `BulletControl` repository contains the code component of the game Ricochet Master, not a standalone runnable project. To use or study the code, it must be integrated into the corresponding Unity project of the game Ricochet Master. Detailed instructions for integration or running may be added later.
